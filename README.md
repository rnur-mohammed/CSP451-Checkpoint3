## ðŸš€ Workflows

- **CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)**  
  Runs linting, testing, and build on each push. Ensures code quality and functionality.

- **Deploy (`deploy.yml`)**  
  Runs on push to `main` branch. Simulates deployment after a successful build.

- **Scheduled CI (`schedule.yml`)**  
  Runs daily (cron job) and also manually with `workflow_dispatch`. Ensures tests run regularly.
